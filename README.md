# Data Cleaning

In this file, you will see the script written in Python to clean data. To collect the data, it has to be webscrapped from Turbostats, which is a sports software company. We used this software to collect the data during the showcase and put it into neat files for analysis. Along with their data, we can use this script to add new datapoints or remove some other datapoints that are unnecessary from within the script. Make sure that Turbostats website format and the code match. One example is to make sure that site links for boxscore are formatted the same each year.

Along with the script, we have historical data which is stored in the Historical Data folder. Keeping the player and team data from each year will be really helpful so that we can use this data to do further research and analysis as needed. Make sure to upload them as CSVs on here so that we can directly read what the data looks like on GitHub. If we get access to more data from the PVTO participants or other high school data, create a Python script to combine all of the data together.
