# Data Cleaning

In this file, you will see the script written in Python. As you will see, we had to webscrape the data from Turbostats, which is a sports software company. We used this software to collect the data during the showcase and put it into neat files for analysis. Along with their data, we can use this script to add new datapoints or remove some other datapoints that are unnecessary from within the script.

Along with the script, we have historical data which is stored in the Historical Data folder. Keeping the player and team data from each year will be really helpful so that we can use this data to do further research and analysis as needed. If we get access to more data from the PVTO participants or other high school data, create a Python script to combine all of the data together.
